###  Quick Tips:
- Replace tech stack details if you used different tools (e.g., different database or state library).
- Add screenshots or a demo link if you have one—visuals help others quickly understand your project.
- Once added as `README.md` to the repo root, GitHub will render it automatically.

Let me know if you'd like help adapting for deployment, adding screenshots, or customizing further!
